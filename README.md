### A little bit about me

```java
public class Tyler {

    private final String role;
    private final Set<String> hobbies;

    public Tyler() {
        this.role = "Software Engineer";
        this.hobbies = Set.of(
            "Playing Video Games", 
            "Growing peppers",
            "Baking", 
            "Amateur Astronomy", 
            "Competitive Programming", 
            "Learning Japanese");
    }
}
```

Most of the activity you'll see on my page will be related to my Japanese study and algorithm practice for competitive programming, however, I do code other things from time to time; typically related to my hobbies.
